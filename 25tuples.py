# Tuples are essentially an array or list, except they are IMMUTABLE!

# You can create a tuple by making a string with a trailing comma 
# Example:

myTuple = 'dog',

# Another way is to use the tuple() constructor method
# Example
newTuple = tuple()

# Don't use tuple as a variable name, since it's a built in method

# Most of the list functions and operators work on Tuples
anotherTuple = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd')
print anotherTuple[0]
# >>>>  'a'
