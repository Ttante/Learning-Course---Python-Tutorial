# The term 'multiple assignment' refers to the nature of a variable
# You may already know, but a variable can have its value changed
# many different times througout a program: this is also called 'mutable'.
# AKA silenced or erased completely. 
# In Python, strings are not mutable, once you make them you cannot 
# change what they contain. Variables are mutable and can change 
# an unlimited time througout a program or algorithm

# Here's an example
my_number = 10
print my_number,  # prints 10
my_number = 15
print my_number	  # prints 15
